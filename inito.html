        <p>
            As a fresher, straight out of college, I wanted to work in the field of mechanical design, where I felt that
            I could still learn more and contribute effectively. I joined <a href="https://www.inito.com/">Inito</a>
            (then Samplytics Technologies)
            as a mechanical design engineer, with little idea of what I would be working on. As it turned out, it was
            just the right time to join, because the work on the new wireless fertility monitor was about to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the project, I contributed to multiple subsystems of the "Insight Wireless Reader," with my
            primary focus on developing the internal imaging system. I was responsible for the mechanical design of this
            system from conceptualisation and prototyping through to a pilot production scale of 1,200 devices per
            month. My work on the optical architecture was significant enough that <b>I am named as a co-inventor on the
                patent for the device’s imaging system.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started with the design process, we defined the core technical objectives, and I worked alongside the
            founder and senior engineering team to establish the system architecture. I utilised Blender for simulations
            and a very primitive 3D printed plastic jig to fix the positions and angles of all the relevant optical
            surfaces. For rapid prototyping, I used SLA 3D printing, utilising both our in-house
            Nexa XiP and our vendor's Figure 4 systems to maintain a fast iteration cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first iteration, of approximately 100 entirely 3D-printed units, was shipped to customers for user
            feedback and design validation. We made key changes in the device based on the results of this beta program.
            In addition, all the parts were to be redesigned for assembly and manufacturing. A detailed FMEA was
            conducted to identify failure modes, and I made the design changes for the failures posing the highest risk.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            For the final production version, I managed the transition to injection moulding for three plastic parts (of
            the imaging system), coordinating with our manufacturing partner in China for both plastic and optical
            elements. <b>I held direct responsibility for the quality control of the optical components, and the three
                plastic components, and established the QC protocols for the entire imaging system.</b> To guarantee
            consistency
            and colour accuracy across every unit, I researched and developed a custom imaging target for device
            calibration at the EoL QC station. I also trained the production staff on the QC protocol to ensure a smooth
            handoff from the design team to the production team for the pilot production.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the technical design, I helped in developing a robust supply chain by sourcing and managing
            multiple vendors across India and China for plastic and optical components. These vendors initially aided us
            in our prototyping efforts, but a few were also transitioned to final production vendors. To maintain our QC
            standards, I conducted on-site audits at manufacturing facilities in China, ensuring that all incoming
            components met our strict quality specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began my journey at Inito with a clear objective: to bring a product to market and see my contributions
            realise their full potential in the hands of users. I can gladly say that I fulfilled this ambition, as
            Inito provided me with the unique experience of designing a complex medical device from scratch. This
            journey has not only provided me with the required exposure to practical engineering, but it has also helped
            me define the trajectory I intend to follow in my professional career.
